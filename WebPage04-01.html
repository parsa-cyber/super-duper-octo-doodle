Unlike other types of doors, the exterior side of the vehicle door contrasts in its design and finish from its interior side (the interior part is typically equipped with a door card (in British English) or a door panel (in American English) that has decorative and functional features.

The exterior side of the door is designed of steel or other material like the rest of the vehicle's exterior. 
In addition, its decorative appearance, typically colored with a design, is intended to match with the rest of the vehicle's exterior, 
the central purpose being to add to the overall aesthetic appeal of the vehicle exterior.

		A car door is a type of door, typically hinged, but sometimes attached by other mechanisms such as tracks, 
		in front of an opening which is used for entering and exiting a vehicle. 
		A vehicle door can be opened to provide access to the opening, or closed to secure it. 
		These doors can be opened manually, or powered electronically. 
		Powered doors are usually found on minivans, high-end cars, or modified cars."

A major safety issue with opened vehicle doors is the assumption at night vehicle doors can provide a warning to other vehicle drivers. 
Unfortunately it is estimated over 50 percent of all vehicle doors have nothing applied to the interior of the vehicle door such as light and/or a reflector. 
Unfortunately these devices need not meet any US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards since no standards apply.
